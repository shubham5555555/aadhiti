## Knowledge base

`lib/kb/` — ~120 topics, each with `understand`, `answer[]`, `next`, `actions`, an intent (learn/check/find/act/connect), and flags for emergency, sensitive (medical/legal/crisis/child) and age groups.

- `safety.ts`, `rights.ts` (+ wellbeing), `health.ts` (+ family), `growth.ts` (career + income), `girls.ts`
- `index.ts` — the 8 adult and 8 girl categories, and the free-text matcher (`understand()`), which handles Devanagari, romanised Marathi/Hindi and everyday phrasing

To go live, replace `understand()` with an LLM call that returns a topic id (or generates an answer in the same three-step shape), keeping the escalation rules.
